# 1-touch-1-input-timed-flip-flop-relay-controller
My purpose for this was to take an car alarm trunk output and roll up and down the rear window on my Toyota 4runner.
It takes 1 pulse to grd from 1 input and controls 2 relays/outputs for a set length of time.
future versions will have potentiometers for time adjustment and an e paper display for funsies.

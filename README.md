# 1-touch-1-input-timed-flip-flop-relay-controller
My purpose for this arduino sketch was to take a car alarm trunk output and roll up and down the rear window on my Toyota 4runner.
It takes 1 pulse to grd from 1 input and controls 2 relays/outputs for a set length of time.
Currently I am using this on a  digispark with a 2 npn transistor circuits to operate the relays.
future versions will have potentiometers for time adjustment and an e paper display for funsies.
